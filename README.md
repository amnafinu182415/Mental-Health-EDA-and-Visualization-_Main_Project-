# Mental-Health-EDA-and-Visualization-_Main_Project-
 This project analyzes Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks dataset. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and comprehensive visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.
This project analyzes mental-health care usage across states, demographic groups, and time periods using the Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks dataset. After cleaning and preparing the data, various EDA techniques and visualizations were applied to explore distribution patterns, group disparities, state-level differences, and monthly trends.
# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent records.
Remove suppressed rows using Suppression Flag.
Convert date columns into proper datetime format.
Standardize column names.
Create derived columns.
Prepare the dataset for deeper EDA and visualization.
# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Summarize key statistics for Value, LowCI, HighCI, and confidence_range.
Identify outliers, unusual confidence intervals, and data inconsistencies.
Explore distributions of demographic groups, subgroups, states, and phases.
Understand the spread and patterns of mental-health care usage.

# Visualizations
Pie charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, box plots,and correlation heatmaps.
# Insight Generation
Provide meaningful interpretations of all charts and statistical analyses.
Highlight key disparities across states and demographic groups.
Identify patterns in mental-health care accessibility and service utilization.
